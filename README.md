# 🌿 Tendril — Compassionate Care

**A compassionate hygiene tracker and anonymous support space that gently helps you care for yourself, one soft task at a time.**

---

## 🧠 Problem

For people struggling with mental health issues or chronic pain, maintaining hygiene tasks like brushing teeth, showering, doing laundry and dishes regularly can become overwhelming and impossible. Most habit-tracking apps use methods that trigger stress and shame in users. There is need for systems that help people develop hygiene habits through compassion and kindness.

## 💡 Our Solution: Tendril

Tendril is a soft and cozy web app that:
- Gently reminds you of hygiene tasks 🪥 🧺 🧼 🛏️
- Tracks a **“softness streak”** — a streak that *pauses* instead of breaking
- Offers an **anonymous support space** where users can share feelings and tips
- Rewrites posts/comments gently using AI, flagging harsh self-talk (e.g. "lazy" → "struggling")
- Delivers a **daily affirmation** through a calming loading screen

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Pastel-themed hygiene checklist with emojis
- ✅ Streak tracker that **pauses**, not punishes
- ✅ Daily “Tip of the Day” affirmation via AI
- ✅ Anonymous post and comment board with “⭐ Star” button
